Copy a line inside the movies array, for example:

js
{ name: "New Movie", id: "YOUR_FILE_ID_HERE" },
From your anywhere share link, copy the ID (the part between /d/ and /view).

Paste the ID into id: "...".

if it is a Google drive file make sure the file in Drive is shared as “Anyone with the link can view” or the embed will not load.
